	   <h2>Hybrid structures</h2>
        <p>The narrative visualization follows the hybrid structure of an interactive slideshow, in which the audience follow an author-directed path overall, but can also investigate some details in each slide. In this case, the viewer follows the chart presented in order of year, but also they can observe the brand market share distribute based on each city in each year seperately.</p>
    
    
    	<h2>Scenes</h2>
        <p>In this visualization, group barchart is utilized in each scene, and throughout the whole slideshow in order to maintain visual consistency. Since the market share is a continous variable, barchart is chosen and stacked in groups to add in another parameter, brands, to the graph. A clearly seperable color pallete is presented to show each different brand, and the corresponding relationship is shown by the legend marks on the side. Also, this color pallete is maintained on every slides for visual consistency. Each scene represent a seperate year's state. </p>

    	<h2>Annotation</h2>
        <p>The annotations in this visualization will appear on the top of the bar when the mouse moves over it, in order to show the current precise data of each bar. It helps viewer to focus on the bar they current looking at and presents the precise number for a further analysis or calculation. Annotations maintain the same text tyle in order to keep visual consistency, and they are cleared when moving to the next slide, cause new data in the next year would be presented at that time. </p>
        
        <h2>Parameters</h2>
        <p>The parameters in this visualization, i.e. the variables, include the cities, the brands, the year (independent variables) and the market share (dependent variable). The cities and the brands are presented alongside with the market share in a same chart on each slide, and the page number, corresponding to the year, is controlled by the viewer, and also controlling the current state of slideshow.</p>

        <h2>Triggers</h2>
        <p>The triggers in this visualization is the hyperlinks button. When viewer clicks on those, they change the parameter of page number to the certain year's slides that link corresponds, and interactive with the viewer. In order to make viewers recognize where they can trigger this kind of event, the hyperlinks are marked by an underline. Also, in the introduction text part of each page, there is a "*" marked instruction to tell the viewer the function of each hyperlink.</p>
